This is a 32-bit kernel for intel machines.  Intel machines are a very
complicated business.  Now in 2018 most computers are 64 bits, so your
compiler must generate 32 binaries.  For GCC use -m32 flag.  For LD,
use -m elf_i386.  (I've added these flags to the build script.)

By the way, in the past --- 2009 ---, I had used tcc (the tiny c
compiler) to compile printf.c.  I can't remember why I did this.
(Maybe to produce a smaller binary?)  But today (4/4/2018) I went back
to GCC because I didn't know how to force tcc to produce 32-bit object
code while running on a 64-bit system.

To compile, just say ``make'' to your shell.  

You'll need nasm, mkisofs, md5sum.  If you're using a GNU DEBIAN
system, you won't easily find mkisofs because they actually call it
genisoimage.  Install genisoimage and make a symbolic link in own your
bin directory.

  ln -s /usr/bin/genisoimage ~/bin/mkisofs
